This app lets you create a campaign, and someone can send a text in and get their elected representatives a letter sent to them! From an SMS! <br/>This project involved developing a full stack application. Express backend powered by Node.js and MySQL hosted on Heroku and Google Cloud SQL. Frontend used React, HTML and CSS.<br/> This was my final project at The Iron Yard - Las Vegas.
